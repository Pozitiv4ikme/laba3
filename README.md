What dominates your array? The dominator of an array is a value that occurs in more than half of the elements of the array. Write the function of finding the dominator. The function must return -1 if the array has no dominator. Take all values in arr> = 0. Example: [3,4,3,2,3,1,3,3] - The dominator of arr is 3, because it occurs in 5 of the 8 elements of arr, and 5 - more than half of 8.
